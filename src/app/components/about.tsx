      <p className="text-gray-400">
        I&rsquo;m a passionate developer with a strong interest in web and blockchain technologies.
        I enjoy building full-stack applications, experimenting with tools like React, NextJs, Node.js,
        Solidity, and exploring the Solana ecosystem.

        <br /><br />

        Always eager to learn and take on new challenges, I believe in writing clean, efficient code
        and turning ideas into real-world solutions. Whether it&apos;s a hackathon project or a personal build,
        I love bringing tech to life.
